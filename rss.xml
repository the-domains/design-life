            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey.

For some, however, a smartwatch isn't enough-it still leaves room for fiddling and distraction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/83d0f5ce299ad3d7f079d449896c88dcc2ec48b8.jpg"></article>]]></description>
